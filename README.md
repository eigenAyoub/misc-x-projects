# Misc
Collection of some projects that I have worked on in the past years, mainly 2016-2020.



## This repo contains:

### Some presentations + A small review on Probabilistic Programming.

* A review on Probabilistic Programming (2020).  (Part of a module at UM6P)
* Two presentations  of different research papers (Both part of different modules at UM6P )
  * Paper 1:  [Limiting Byzantine Influence in Multihop Asynchronous Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5824.pdf)
  * Paper 2:  [Generic Attacks on Secure Outsourced Databases ](https://robobees.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/generic.pdf)
* My Master's presentation (2019)



### NLP project (2018): Classification of tweets. Pre-DL NLP world (BoW, Glove, etc.). 

* **Task report:** A report concerning the different aspects of the project
* **2 Notebooks:**  Main tokenizer I used + Some approaches that I used for modelling
* **acronyms_mapper.txt** >> A long list that I scrapped from an online acronyms dictionary, I used it to augment the meaning of tweets (sort of a data augmentation).

### A few Data Science projects (2017-2020, during ENSIAS + UM6P)
  
* **PFA:** A data science project from 2017 (in French). Exploring Classic ML. (It was a module at ENSIAS)
  * Contains: Rapport_PFA_2017 && Presentation_PFA_2017

* **DS_Kaggle:** A data science project, Kaggle style, includes:
  * EDA, modeling (classic ML algos: RF, XGB, etc. No DL) 
  * Using of ensemble methods,  stacking.
  * Some feature engineering and selection


###  Scala project (during UM6P 2019)
 * Implementation of a distributed polling system in Scala
    * Based on the paper: [Decentralized Polling with Respectable Participants](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00629455/document)
